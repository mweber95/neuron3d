## SNEMI3D dataset

The SNEMI3D dataset was published in the context of the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (San Francisco, CA, April 7-11th 2013). The dataset can be downloaded after registration on http://brainiac2.mit.edu/SNEMI3D/home. Additionally, 4 pre-processed TIF files are available under https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3371325 and serve just for evaluating the output of machine learning algorithms.

## Pre-processing the dataset for training
